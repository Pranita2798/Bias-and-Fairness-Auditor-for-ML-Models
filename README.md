# ML Bias and Fairness Auditor

A comprehensive web application for detecting and analyzing bias in machine learning models. This tool helps data scientists, ML engineers, and organizations ensure their models are fair, ethical, and compliant with regulatory standards.

## 🎯 Features

### Core Functionality
- **Model Upload & Analysis**: Support for popular ML frameworks (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- **Bias Detection**: Multiple fairness metrics including demographic parity, equalized odds, and calibration
- **Group Analysis**: Comprehensive analysis across protected attributes (gender, age, race, etc.)
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Real-time visualization of bias metrics and fairness scores
- **Automated Recommendations**: AI-powered suggestions for bias mitigation strategies
- **Comprehensive Reports**: Generate executive, technical, and compliance reports

### Advanced Features
- **Multi-format Support**: Upload models in .pkl, .joblib, .h5, .pb, .pth formats
- **Dataset Integration**: Analyze training data for bias indicators
- **Historical Tracking**: Monitor bias metrics over time
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Built-in support for fairness regulations and standards
- **Export Capabilities**: Download reports in PDF, HTML, JSON, and DOCX formats

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ml-bias-auditor.git
cd ml-bias-auditor
```

2. Install dependencies:

```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

## 📊 Supported Metrics

### Fairness Metrics
- **Demographic Parity**: Equal positive prediction rates across groups
- **Equalized Odds**: Equal true positive and false positive rates across groups
- **Calibration**: Prediction probabilities match actual outcomes across groups
- **Individual Fairness**: Similar individuals receive similar predictions

### Bias Detection
- **Statistical Parity**: Difference in positive rates between groups
- **Predictive Parity**: Difference in precision between groups
- **Treatment Equality**: Difference in error rates between groups

## 📈 Metrics Explained

### Demographic Parity
Measures whether the positive prediction rate is similar across different groups. A score of 1.0 indicates perfect parity.

### Equalized Odds
Ensures that true positive and false positive rates are equal across groups. Critical for fair treatment in decision-making systems.

### Calibration
Verifies that prediction probabilities are accurate across all groups. Important for systems where probability estimates are used.
